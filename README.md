    "structure": "**Overview**\n\nThe article provides a general overview of the feature request system in MoEngage, but it lacks detailed information on how to suggest a feature, what types of features can be suggested, and how the feature request process works.

    "style_guide": "**Overview of the article alignment with style guide: 7.2/10**\n\nThe article provides clear and concise information about suggesting a feature, submitting a product idea, and feature status. However, there are areas that need improvement to better align with the style guide.\n\n**Sections that are not very aligned to style guide:**\n\n1. **Privacy Preference Center** (Rating: 4/10)\n\t* The section seems out of place and not directly relevant to the use or setup of the MoEngage customer engagement platform.\n\t* Suggestion: Tailor the content to directly relate to MoEngage and its implications for the user. Simplify language and provide clear actions or steps related to setting up or using the MoEngage platform.\n\t* Example: \"Manage Your Cookie Preferences: To ensure our website works properly, we use strictly necessary cookies. Learn how to manage your cookie preferences and ensure a seamless experience with MoEngage.\"\n2. **Cookie List** (Rating: 2/10)\n\t* The section lacks a clear and concise description of what the user is seeing or what actions they need to take.\n\t* Suggestion: Add a brief description of the Cookie List feature, its purpose, and instructions on how to use it. Use action-oriented language to guide the user effectively.\n\t* Example: \"The Cookie List section allows you to manage cookies and consent preferences. To configure your preferences: 1. Use the search icon to find specific cookies. 2. Filter cookies using the filter icon. 3. Clear your selections using the clear checkbox.\"\n3. **How can we improve this article?** (Rating: 6/10)\n\t* The section seems to be a feedback form, but it could be more customer-focused and engaging.\n\t* Suggestion: Add a brief introduction to set the context for the feedback form. Use more descriptive labels for the options and consider adding a character limit for the comments field.\n\t* Example: \"We value your input! Please help us improve this article by providing your feedback. What did you think of this article? [Select an option]\"\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n* Use a more conversational tone throughout the article to make it more engaging and customer-focused.\n* Consider adding visual elements, such as screenshots or icons, to break up the text and make it more engaging.\n* Use action-oriented language to guide the user effectively and encourage them to take specific actions.\n\n**Sections that are well-aligned with style guide:**\n\n* **Suggest a Feature** (Rating: 8/10)\n* **Submit a Product Idea** (Rating: 8/10)\n* **Feature Status** (Rating: 8/10)\n* **How Does This Help?** (Rating: 8/10)\n* **Manage Consent Preferences** (Rating: 8/10)\n\nThese sections provide clear and concise information, use a customer-focused tone, and guide the user effectively.

## Tech Stack
I have used python to implement the ai agent.
1. Selenium: To fetch the article html.
2. Beautiful Soup: For extracting article from html
3. Langchain and Langgraph: To Build the Agent.
4. LLM api: Used [groq api](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
5. Docker: To containerize and run the application in an isolated environment.


## How to Run
System Requirement: **Docker** must be installed on you machine
- In terminal make you current dir as root of this repo and run following command:
```
$ docker compose up
```

- The agent server will listen at http://localhost:8000/


## Implementation
1. Visit MoEngage article URL (https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/...). It then downloads the article HTML content. 
2. Converts article from html to markdown format.
3. *Ai agent execution*: The same agent is executed interatively for each criterion provided in the assignment, wtih corresponding criterion prompt. Following operation are perform inside the agent:

    a. **Split_article:** Article is split into section based on heading.

    b. **Generate_reviews:** For each section, review based on criterion is generated with use of llm.

    c. **Get readability score:** Calculate Flesch-Kincaid reading ease score on the article.

    d. **Generate final review:** All reviews generate for sections and consolidated and final review generate using llm.

## Challenges faced
- Prompt Sensitivity: LLM responses varied based on minor prompt changes, requiring tuning for consistency.

- Rate Limits: LLM API rate limits hit due to multiple api calls, t avoid the rate of api hit is decreased that leads to shower response generation.
