<summary>Completeness(click me)</summary>
**Overview**

The article provides a general overview of the feature request system in MoEngage, but it lacks detailed information on how to suggest a feature, what types of features can be suggested, and how the suggestions are prioritized. Based on the reviews of each section, the overall completeness rating of the article is **6.8/10**.

**Does the article provide enough detail for a user to understand and implement the feature or concept?**

No, the article does not provide enough detail for a user to fully understand and implement the feature or concept. While it provides a general overview of the feature request system, it lacks specific details on how to suggest a feature, what types of features can be suggested, and how the suggestions are prioritized.

**Sections that require examples and what type of example needed**

The following sections require examples:

1. **Suggest a Feature**: An example of a suggested feature, such as "For instance, you can suggest a new feature to enhance user segmentation or improve campaign analytics."
2. **How Does This Help?**: An example of a scenario where a user's feature suggestion was implemented, such as "For example, a customer suggested a feature to integrate MoEngage with a popular CRM platform. Our product team reviewed the request, prioritized it, and eventually implemented the integration, which benefited multiple customers."
3. **Submit a Product Idea**: An example of a well-written product idea submission, including a clear title, detailed description, and relevant product area selection.
4. **Feature Status**: An example of a scenario where a user submits a feature request and it moves through different statuses (e.g., from "Awaiting Feedback" to "Planned" to "Released").
5. **How can we improve this article?**: A screenshot of where the feature status link can be found or an example of how to use it.

These examples would help illustrate the process and make it more relatable to the user, providing a better understanding of the feature request system in MoEngage.

<summary>Structure(click me)</summary>
**Overview**

The article's flow and structure have been reviewed, and the overall rating is 8/10. The reviews suggest that the article is well-structured and easy to follow, but some sections lack detailed information and could benefit from more context.

**Section Suggestions**

* **Suggest a Feature**: The paragraph size is too long and should be broken down into a list format for better clarity.
* **How Does This Help?**: The first paragraph is too short and could be merged with the second paragraph for better flow.
* **Feature Status**: The paragraph size is too short, and more detailed explanations and examples should be provided. A brief introduction or explanation before the list would provide context on why this feature status section is important and how it relates to the overall setup process.

**Headings/Subheadings Review**

* The headings and subheadings seem to enable logical content flow and easy navigation.
* The sequence of sections, from "How Does This Help?" to "Submit a Product Idea" and then "Feature Status", appears logical.

**Answers to Questions**

1. **Does the information flow logically from section to section?**: Yes, the information flows logically from section to section.
2. **Is it easy to navigate and find specific information?**: Yes, it is easy to navigate and find specific information.

However, some improvements can be made:

* Consider adding a brief introduction to the "Suggest a Feature" section to explain how it fits into the overall onboarding and initial setup process.
* Provide more detailed explanations and examples in the "Feature Status" section to improve clarity.

No significant changes are needed in the heading/subheading structure. The current structure appears to support easy navigation and logical content flow.

## Tracking Users in Flows

* Difficult to understand sentences:
	+ "Visualize User Trips in Flows" - This sentence is unclear. 
	+ "Conversion Attribution in Flows" - This term may be unfamiliar to non-technical marketers.
* Suggested alternatives:
	+ "Visualize User Trips in Flows: This feature allows you to see the journey of users through your flows, helping you understand their behavior and identify areas for improvement."

	+ Provide a brief explanation of what "control group" means in this context.

## Tracking Users Who Converted

* Difficult to understand sentences:
	+ "The event is tracked for each conversion, so if a user performs the conversion multiple times during their flow trip, this event will be raised for each recorded conversion and also for each of the defined goals."
	+ "By filtering using **Flow Id**, you can find the list of unique users whose conversion was attributed to this flow."
* Suggested alternatives:
	+ "Every time a user converts, we track it. If a user converts multiple times, we'll track each conversion."
	+ "Use the flow's unique ID to find users who converted because of that specific flow."

## Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow

* Suggested alternatives:
	+ "Cookies are small files that help websites remember your preferences. They can help us provide a more tailored experience for you, but you can choose to limit their use."
	+ Provide examples to illustrate how cookies work and how they can personalize the user experience.

## Manage Consent Preferences

* Difficult to understand sentences:
	+ "They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms."
	+ "They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site."
* Suggested alternatives:
	+ "These cookies are set when you take actions like logging in or submitting forms."
	+ "These cookies help us understand which pages are most visited and how users navigate our site."

## Privacy Preference Centerlink > Cookie List

* Difficult to understand sentences:
	+ The presence of `dialog closed` in the text seems out of place and unclear in its context.
	+ The use of technical terms like "Powered by Onetrust" and "Cookie Consent"
* Suggested alternatives:
	+ Provide a brief explanation of what "Powered by Onetrust" means and its relevance to the platform.

<summary>Completeness(click me)</summary>
**Overview**

The article "Tracking Users in Flows" has been reviewed for completeness, and the overall rating is 6.5/10. The article provides some information on tracking users in flows, but it lacks detailed explanations and practical examples to make it easier for non-technical marketers to understand and implement the features.

**Does the article provide enough detail for a user to understand and implement the feature or concept?**

No, the article does not provide enough detail for a user to understand and implement the feature or concept. The sections lack concrete examples, and some sections appear to be incomplete or unrelated to the topic.

**Sections that require examples and what type of example needed**

The following sections require examples:

1. **Tracking Users in Flows**
	* Type of example needed: A step-by-step guide on how to track users in flows, including screenshots or a real-life scenario.
2. **Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow**
	* Type of example needed: A concrete example of how to use the "Flow Id" or "Flow Name" to segment users who entered a specific flow, including screenshots or a step-by-step guide.
3. **Tracking Users Who Converted**
	* Type of example needed: A concrete example with actual values for the event attributes (e.g., Flow Id, Version Name, Campaign Id), including screenshots or a visual representation of the segmentation process.
4. **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow**
	* Type of example needed: A concrete example of how to use the filters in a real-world scenario, such as "Find users who exited a flow due to not completing a purchase within a certain time frame".
5. **Manage Consent Preferences**
	* Type of example needed: An example of how user tracking works in a flow, including how cookies are used to identify and track users, and what kind of data is collected.

The following sections are incomplete or unrelated to the topic:

1. **How can we improve this article?** ( appears to be a feedback submission form)
2. **Privacy Preference Center** (unrelated to the topic of tracking users in flows)
3. **Cookie List** (appears to be incomplete and unrelated to the topic)

<details>
<summary>Structure(click me)</summary>
**Overview:** 
The article's flow and structure have room for improvement, with a rating of 6/10. The reviews suggest that some sections have long paragraphs that need to be broken down, while others lack relevant content. The use of lists and tables is effective in presenting information, but some sections seem misplaced or incomplete.

**Section Suggestions:**

* **Tracking Users in Flows:** This section seems to be misplaced or incorrectly included, with content related to cookie policies. It needs to be rewritten to focus on tracking users in flows, with a brief paragraph of 1-2 sentences and the use of lists (e.g., bullet points) to improve clarity.
* **Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow:** The first paragraph is a bit long and could be broken up into two paragraphs for easier reading.
* **Tracking Users Who Converted:** The second paragraph is a bit long and contains a table, which might make it harder to read. Consider breaking it up into shorter paragraphs.
* **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow:** The section seems to be incomplete or misplaced, with content that appears to be a generic feedback form. It needs to be rewritten to focus on the topic, with relevant information and possibly the use of lists or tables to improve clarity.

**Headings/Subheadings Review:**

* The headings and subheadings seem to enable logical content flow, with a clear hierarchy of information: "Tracking Users in Flows" as an introductory section, followed by "Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow," "Tracking Users Who Converted," and "Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow."
* However, the content of "Tracking Users in Flows" seems out of place and should be revised or removed.

**Does the information flow logically from section to section?**
 Mostly, yes. The sections on tracking users who entered, converted, or exited a flow seem to follow a logical sequence. However, the introductory section "Tracking Users in Flows" seems misplaced.

**Is it easy to navigate and find specific information?**
 Mostly, yes. The use of clear headings and subheadings helps navigation. However, the incomplete or misplaced sections might make it harder to find specific information.

**Improvement Suggestions:**

* Revise or remove the "Tracking Users in Flows" section to ensure it provides a clear introduction to the topic.
* Break up long paragraphs in sections like "Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow" and "Tracking Users Who Converted."
* Rewrite the "Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow" section to focus on the topic and include relevant information.

    "structure": "**Overview:** \nThe article's flow and structure have room for improvement, with a rating of 6/10. The reviews suggest that some sections have long paragraphs that need to be broken down, while others lack relevant content. The use of lists and tables is effective in presenting information, but some sections seem misplaced or incomplete.\n\n**Section Suggestions:**\n\n* **Tracking Users in Flows:** This section seems to be misplaced or incorrectly included, with content related to cookie policies. It needs to be rewritten to focus on tracking users in flows, with a brief paragraph of 1-2 sentences and the use of lists (e.g., bullet points) to improve clarity.\n* **Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow:** The first paragraph is a bit long and could be broken up into two paragraphs for easier reading.\n* **Tracking Users Who Converted:** The second paragraph is a bit long and contains a table, which might make it harder to read. Consider breaking it up into shorter paragraphs.\n* **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow:** The section seems to be incomplete or misplaced, with content that appears to be a generic feedback form. It needs to be rewritten to focus on the topic, with relevant information and possibly the use of lists or tables to improve clarity.\n\n**Headings/Subheadings Review:**\n\n* The headings and subheadings seem to enable logical content flow, with a clear hierarchy of information: \"Tracking Users in Flows\" as an introductory section, followed by \"Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow,\" \"Tracking Users Who Converted,\" and \"Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow.\"\n* However, the content of \"Tracking Users in Flows\" seems out of place and should be revised or removed.\n\n**Does the information flow logically from section to section?**\n Mostly, yes. The sections on tracking users who entered, converted, or exited a flow seem to follow a logical sequence. However, the introductory section \"Tracking Users in Flows\" seems misplaced.\n\n**Is it easy to navigate and find specific information?**\n Mostly, yes. The use of clear headings and subheadings helps navigation. However, the incomplete or misplaced sections might make it harder to find specific information.\n\n**Improvement Suggestions:**\n\n* Revise or remove the \"Tracking Users in Flows\" section to ensure it provides a clear introduction to the topic.\n* Break up long paragraphs in sections like \"Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow\" and \"Tracking Users Who Converted.\"\n* Rewrite the \"Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow\" section to focus on the topic and include relevant information.",

    "completeness": "**Overview**\n\nThe article \"Tracking Users in Flows\" has been reviewed for completeness, and the overall rating is 6.5/10. The article provides some information on tracking users in flows, but it lacks detailed explanations and practical examples to make it easier for non-technical marketers to understand and implement the features.\n\n**Does the article provide enough detail for a user to understand and implement the feature or concept?**\n\nNo, the article does not provide enough detail for a user to understand and implement the feature or concept. The sections lack concrete examples, and some sections appear to be incomplete or unrelated to the topic.\n\n**Sections that require examples and what type of example needed**\n\nThe following sections require examples:\n\n1. **Tracking Users in Flows**\n\t* Type of example needed: A step-by-step guide on how to track users in flows, including screenshots or a real-life scenario.\n2. **Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow**\n\t* Type of example needed: A concrete example of how to use the \"Flow Id\" or \"Flow Name\" to segment users who entered a specific flow, including screenshots or a step-by-step guide.\n3. **Tracking Users Who Converted**\n\t* Type of example needed: A concrete example with actual values for the event attributes (e.g., Flow Id, Version Name, Campaign Id), including screenshots or a visual representation of the segmentation process.\n4. **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow**\n\t* Type of example needed: A concrete example of how to use the filters in a real-world scenario, such as \"Find users who exited a flow due to not completing a purchase within a certain time frame\".\n5. **Manage Consent Preferences**\n\t* Type of example needed: An example of how user tracking works in a flow, including how cookies are used to identify and track users, and what kind of data is collected.\n\nThe following sections are incomplete or unrelated to the topic:\n\n1. **How can we improve this article?** ( appears to be a feedback submission form)\n2. **Privacy Preference Center** (unrelated to the topic of tracking users in flows)\n3. **Cookie List** (appears to be incomplete and unrelated to the topic)",

    "style_guide": "**Overview of the article alignment with style guide: 7.2/10**\n\nThe article provides useful information on tracking users in flows, but there are areas that need improvement to align with the style guide. The sections that are not very aligned with the style guide are:\n\n1. **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flowlink > How can we improve this article?**\n\t* Rating: 2/10\n\t* Suggestions:\n\t\t+ Remove the feedback form from this section and place it at the end of the article or provide a separate link for users to provide feedback.\n\t\t+ Add relevant information on how to track users who exited a flow link, such as definition, importance, steps to track, and metrics to analyze.\n\t* Example: Rephrase the section to provide clear instructions on how to track users who exited a flow link.\n\n2. **Privacy Preference Centerlink**\n\t* Rating: 4/10\n\t* Suggestions:\n\t\t+ Rephrase the section to focus on how user privacy preferences and cookie settings might impact the use of the MoEngage platform.\n\t\t+ Simplify complex sentences and technical terms.\n\t* Example: Rewritten section: \"To ensure accurate tracking of users in flows, please note that MoEngage uses cookies to personalize the user experience. You can manage your cookie preferences to allow or block certain types of cookies.\"\n\n3. **Privacy Preference Centerlink > Manage Consent Preferences**\n\t* Rating: 4/10\n\t* Suggestions:\n\t\t+ Use a more customer-focused tone and language.\n\t\t+ Simplify complex sentences and technical terms.\n\t\t+ Break down the text into shorter paragraphs and use bullet points or numbered lists.\n\t* Example: Rewritten text: \"**Manage Your Cookie Preferences**: We use cookies on our website to provide a better experience. Here's what you need to know: ...\"\n\n4. **Privacy Preference Centerlink > Cookie List**\n\t* Rating: 2/10\n\t* Suggestions:\n\t\t+ Rephrase the section heading to be more descriptive and concise.\n\t\t+ Simplify the language used to explain the cookie consent management system.\n\t\t+ Provide clear instructions on how to use the section.\n\t* Example: Rewritten section: \"**Manage Cookie Preferences**: We want to ensure you're comfortable with the cookies we use. Please review and manage your preferences below.\"\n\nThe sections that are well-aligned with the style guide are:\n\n1. **Tracking Users Who Entered a Flow**\n\t* Rating: 8/10\n2. **Tracking Users Who Converted**\n\t* Rating: 8/10\n3. **Tracking Users Who Exited a Flow**\n\t* Rating: 8/10\n\nThese sections provide clear and concise information, and the language is customer-focused. However, there are still some suggestions for improvement, such as adding brief introductions, breaking up long sentences, and using more action-oriented language."

## Tech Stack
I have used python to implement the ai agent.
1. Selenium: To fetch the article html.
2. Beautiful Soup: For extracting article from html
3. Langchain and Langgraph: To Build the Agent.
4. LLM api: Used [groq api](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)
5. Docker: To containerize and run the application in an isolated environment.


## How to Run

System Requirement: **Docker** must be installed on you machine
- With reference of `agent/.env.example` make `agent/.env` file and add groq api key.
- In terminal make you current dir as root of this repo and run following command:
```
$ docker compose up
```

- The agent server will listen at http://localhost:8000/

- Make get request with url
```
curl http://localhost:8000/suggestion?url=https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042322691-User-Attribute-Profile-Integration-Validation
```
Note: it take about 4-5 min to load the response
## Implementation
1. Visit MoEngage article URL (https://help.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/...). It then downloads the article HTML content. 
2. Converts article from html to markdown format.
3. *Ai agent execution*: The same agent is executed interatively for each criterion provided in the assignment, wtih corresponding criterion prompt. Following operation are perform inside the agent:

    a. **Split_article:** Article is split into section based on heading.

    b. **Generate_reviews:** For each section, review based on criterion is generated with use of llm.

    c. **Get readability score:** Calculate Flesch-Kincaid reading ease score on the article.

    d. **Generate final review:** All reviews generate for sections and consolidated and final review generate using llm.

## Challenges faced
- Prompt Sensitivity: LLM responses varied based on minor prompt changes, requiring tuning for consistency.

- Rate Limits: LLM API rate limits hit due to multiple api calls, t avoid the rate of api hit is decreased that leads to shower response generation.
